# Resume Parser Microservice

This microservice is responsible for parsing resumes (CVs) into structured data using AI. It extracts key information from resumes and returns it in a structured JSON format.

## Features

- Resume parsing from various file formats (PDF, DOCX, DOC, TXT)
- AI-powered extraction of profile information using OpenAI's models
- Profile photo extraction capabilities
- Structured data output in JSON format

## Architecture

The microservice follows a clean architecture pattern:

- **API Layer** (`/api/hcp`): REST endpoint for accessing the resume parsing service
- **Core Layer** (`/core/user_profile`): Business logic for resume parsing
- **Models Layer** (`/models/user_profile`): AI models for text extraction and processing
- **Utils Layer** (`/utils`): Shared utilities for file handling, serialization, etc.

## Setup and Installation

```bash
# Setup Python environment (Python 3.12+ required)
# Install pyenv (recommended)
brew install pyenv

# Install pipenv
brew install pipenv

# Clone and setup
cd micro-service-resume-parser
cp .env.example .env  # Create .env and set up required values

# Install dependencies
pipenv install --dev

# Activate virtual environment
pipenv shell

# Optional: Install pre-commit hooks
pre-commit install
```

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file with the following variables:

```
# OpenAI Configuration
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
OPENAI_ORG_ID=your_openai_org_id
OPENAI_PROJECT_ID=your_openai_project_id
OPENAI_PARSER_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini  # Or another suitable model

# Supabase Configuration
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
SUPABASE_PRIVATE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_supabase_key

# Resume Processing Configuration
CV_PAGES_LIMIT=6  # Max pages to process per resume
CV_DPI=180  # DPI for PDF rendering
DEBUG_IMAGES=0  # Set to 1 to save debug images of extracted photos

# Logging
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
```

## API Endpoints

### Parse Resume
