# CI/CD Verification Checklist

## ✅ Current Setup

Your GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline is already configured and will automatically:

1. **On every push to `main` or `master` branch:**
   - Build Docker images for all 4 services
   - Push images to AWS ECR
   - Update ECS task definitions
   - Deploy new versions to ECS cluster
   - Wait for services to stabilize

2. **On every pull request:**
   - Run Python tests
   - Run linting checks
   - Run integration tests

## 🔍 Required GitHub Secrets

Make sure these secrets are configured in your GitHub repository settings:
(Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions)

- [ ] `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
- [ ] `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`

## 🚀 To Test the Pipeline

1. Make a small change to any service
2. Commit and push to main:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Test CI/CD pipeline"
   git push origin main
   ```
3. Go to your GitHub repository → Actions tab
4. Watch the "Deploy to AWS ECS" workflow run

## 📊 Monitor Deployment

After pushing, you can monitor:
- GitHub Actions: Check the Actions tab in your repository
- AWS ECS Console: Watch services update in real-time
- CloudWatch Logs: Monitor application logs

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

If deployment fails, check:
1. GitHub secrets are correctly set
2. AWS IAM user has necessary permissions
3. ECR repositories exist
4. ECS cluster and services are created

The pipeline will automatically notify you of success/failure after each deployment.
